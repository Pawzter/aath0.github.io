Our lab focuses on studying human perception and cognition from a cognitive and computational neuroscience perspective. 

Our research interests focus in the following areas:
* Investigating the neural underpinnings and computational contents of predictive circuits of the human brain
* Evaluating how these circuits are modulated by the loss of consciousness
* Developing novel computational and machine learning techniques for analyzing electrophysiological activity

To answer these questions we are using electrophysiological recordings in humans (scalp and intracranial electroencephalography -EEG- and measurements of single unit activity), in combination with machine learning algorithms.
