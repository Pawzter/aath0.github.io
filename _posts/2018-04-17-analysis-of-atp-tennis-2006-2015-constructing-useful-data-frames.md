This post is the second in a series covering an analysis of ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) tennis matches.  

My first post in this series covered an introduction to the data I would be working with, as well as some cleaning and organizing of the data.  This post will cover how I constructed more useful data structures from the `atp` data frame I described in the earlier post.  

If you would like to read my first post in this series, you can find it here.  Also, you can find my entire R project here.  (INCLUDE LINKS)
