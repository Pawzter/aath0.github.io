- also need to fix image in other post and maybe add horizontal line to it
- fix david ferrer and maybe andy murry in some graph?

# introduction 
# link to other posts
# discussion of great players between 2006 and 2015, which players are obvioiusly the great players
# mention those who won the most tournamenets, novaks famous 2015 and fed's great 2006
# clearly this subset of data is missing some years of tennis
# players obviously those who player better and are more consistent.

# go into histogram of avg pct of rounds won - who are the 3 outliers to the right
# then 3 nice graphs
# then scatterplot of service games won vs height
# then random percentages

# then show that federer playes the shortest matches in the first 4 rounds of majors

# conclusion
