* **September 2018**: It's time to visit Bremen again to teach! This year I'll be teaching at the [PIP Summer School on Machine Learning](http://www.pip.uni-bremen.de/news/pip-summer-school-2018/), organised by the Postgraduate International Programme in Physics and Electrical Engineering (PIP) of the University of Bremen. I'm very excited to give a course on machine learning applications for analyzing EEG data using python! The course material will be posted here soon!

* **July 2018**: Our preprint with [Bastian Greshake Tzovaras](https://tzovar.as/) on participant diversity in data sharing initiatives in neuroscience and genetics is out! In this opinion paper we discuss why data sharing initiatives need to increase ethnic and social diversity in their cohorts, and have more rigorous ways of collecting socio-demographic data. [You can find our preprint here](https://peerj.com/preprints/27079/).

* **June 2018**: I look forward to visiting the [2018 annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3821) and [OHBM hackathon](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2018/), and to presenting our recent work on reconstructing oscillatory activity from the hippocampus and amygala using high precision magnetoencephalography!

* **June 2018**: Our manuscript on modeling associative learning based on resposnes on the autonomic nervous system has been accepted for publication on PLOS Computational Biology! We found that during fear conditioning, skin conductance and pupil responses map onto different quantities of a probabilistic learning model: pupil size reflects the estimated threat probability, while skin conductance reflects a combination of the estimated threat and the uncertainty over the estimate.
