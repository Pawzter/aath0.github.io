* **October 2019**: Athina will be presenting work on intracranial EEG recordings and auditory predictions at the annual meeting for the [Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019/Sessions-and-Events/Scientific-Program), in Chicago.

* **September 2019**: [Pinar GÃ¶ktepe](https://ccneuro.github.io/pgoektepe/) is joining us to work as a research assistant on the development of reproducible pipelines for algorithmic decision-making in the field of neuroscience!

* **July 2019**: We have received an Open Science grant by [Mozilla](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/announcing-9-awards-for-open-science-eaf8f5b36e85) to develop open educational resources on algorithmic decision-making in neuroscience! Great collaboration with [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/) and [Elpiniki Apostolaki-Iosifidou](https://elpiniki.io/)! 

* **June 2019**: [New paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24689) on the use of high-precision magnetoencephalography for reconstructing sources from the amygdala and hippocampus is out! 

* **June 2019**: [New paper](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz076/5523201) on participatory research, in collaboration with [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/)

* **October 2018**: Athina will be co-facilitating three sessions at this year's [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/), on October 26-28th in London. Join us in the [Digital Inclusion](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Digital-Inclusion), [Openness](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Openness) and [Decentralization](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralisation) spaces to discuss about [data sharing](https://guidebook.com/guide/147793/event/21682452/), [machine learning](https://guidebook.com/guide/147793/event/21682711/) and [improving inclusivity in science and technology](https://guidebook.com/guide/147793/event/21682463/).

* **September 2018**: Teaching at the [PIP Summer School on Machine Learning](http://www.pip.uni-bremen.de/news/pip-summer-school-2018/), organised by the Postgraduate International Programme in Physics and Electrical Engineering (PIP) of the University of Bremen, giving a course on machine learning applications for analyzing EEG data using python.

* **August 2018**: Athina will join the [Round 6 of the Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-6/) training program as a mentor!

* **July 2018**: Our preprint with [Bastian Greshake Tzovaras](https://tzovar.as/) on participant diversity in data sharing initiatives in neuroscience and genetics is out! In this opinion paper we discuss why data sharing initiatives need to increase ethnic and social diversity in their cohorts, and have more rigorous ways of collecting socio-demographic data.
