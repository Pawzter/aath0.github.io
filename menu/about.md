title: Hi, I'm Ethan!
---

I'm Ethan Wicker.  I'm an aspiring Data Analyst and a current AP Statistics Teacher at East Chapel Hill High School in Chapel Hill, NC.

I graduated from North Carolina State University in 2017 with a BS in Mathematics and a BS in Mathematics Education.  After teaching for a year, I decided to supplement my own education and get in the field of data analytics and data science.  This is my personal blog and portfolio.

In addition to my math background, I've completed both of DataCamp's R Programmer and Data Analyst career tracks, approximately 76 hours of material.  I've also completed a thorough SQL boot camp course on Udemy, have read numerous blogs and articles, and have listened to various podcasts.

Check out the Resources tab for some of my favorite data science resources.

This blog has three main purposes.

* To provide myself with a creative space and platform to post my personal data analytics projects
* To provide a future employer proof of my analytic, problem solving, and communication skills.
* To serve as a clear and easy to understand education resource for anyone new to data analytics who happens to stumble by.  Currently the majority of my posts will be using the analytics language R, but that may evolve some in the future.
