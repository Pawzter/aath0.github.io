title: Hi, I'm Ethan!

I'm going to come back and update this later.

For now, I'm an future Data Analyst and a current AP Statistics Teacher at East Chapel Hill High School.

This blog has three purposes.  I'll come back and add detail to this later.

For now though, the purposes of this blog are

* to give myself a creative space and platform to post my personal data analytics projects
* to give potentional employers proof of my analytical abilities
* to provide an education resource to anyone new to data analytics or the statistical analytics languaage R.  I hope my posts will be engaging and useful, but also clear and concise, and easy to understand.
