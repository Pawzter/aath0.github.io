I am a visiting scholar at [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/), at the University of California, Berkeley.

I am investigating how we form auditory predictions, according to our

		or <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awv041">awareness</a>.

To study human cognition, I am using imaging (EEG, MEG, ECoG) and psychophysiological techniques (skin conductance, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12801/full">pupil size</a>, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12775/full">startle responses</a>), in combination with <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320311001440">machine learning</a> and modeling approaches. My goal is to characterise neural and computational mechanisms which allow typical individuals to perceive their environment and, ultimately, to examine how these are disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness.
