### Auditory oddball in python
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/AuditoryOddball) to create pure tones in python and to run an auditory oddball paradigm, using pygame.

### Importing Neuralynx data
Wrapper functions to import Neuralynx data in fieldtrip and transform them to .fif format, which can be then read in MNE, python. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/aath0/EEG_Neuralynx2Fieldtrip2MNE)


### R functions to plot EEG data
Some [functions](https://github.com/aath0/REEG) to import fieldtrip EEG data in R and plot event related responses.

### Analysis of intracranial EEG data
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/iEEG) for analyzing iEEG/ECoG data with fieldtrip.


### How does research treat underrepresented minorities?
An openly and collectively designed survey to evaluate how members of underrepresented minorities can be better integrated in scientific research, developped in the context of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) program.
