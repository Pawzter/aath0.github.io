### Importing Neuralynx data to eeglab and fieldtrip 
Wrapper functions to import Neuralynx data in fieldtrip and transform the to .fif format, which can be then read in MNE, python. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/aath0/EEG_Neuralynx2Fieldtrip2MNE)

### Auditory oddball paradigm in python
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/AuditoryOddball) to create pure tones in python and to run an auditory oddball paradigm, using pygame.

### How does research treat underrepresented minorities?
An openly and collectively designed survey to evaluate how members of underrepresented minorities can be better integrated in scientific research, developped in the context of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) program. For more details please visit the project's [repository](https://github.com/aath0/MinoritiesInResearch)

### R functions to plot EEG data
Some [functions](https://github.com/aath0/REEG) to import fieldtrip EEG data in R and plot event related responses.

### Analysis of intracranial EEG data
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/iEEG) for analyzing iEEG/ECoG data with fieldtrip.
