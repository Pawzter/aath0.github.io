## Phd student

Applications are invited for one PhD student in neuroscience, at the University of Bern, Switzerland. The research focus will be on studying the neural and computational mechanisms underlying the generation of sensory predictions. To this aim, the employed student will design computational models of learning and will combine those with electrophysiological recordings in humans to investigate predictive processes in the auditory modality, in wakefulness and sleep.

Our [group](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/about_us/team/cognitive_computational_neuroscience_ccn/index_eng.html) is using scalp and intracranial electroencephalography -EEG- recordings, machine learning and computational modeling techniques, as well as single-unit measurements in humans. The positions will be based at the Institute for Computer Science and Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland, under the supervision of Athina Tzovara.

#### What we offer:

* Funded positions for three years, according to Swiss National Science Foundation regulations
* Access to scalp and intracranial EEG recordings
* Funding for conferences or summer schools
* Interdisciplinary and international research environment at the University of Bern

#### Your profile:

*	You are interested in using computational tools to study functions of the human brain
*	You have experience or would like to acquire experience in analyzing time-series data e.g. EEG
*	You are fluent in English

#### Requirements :

* Master in biomedical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, physics or a related discipline
* Experience with analysing physiological data or time-series data
* Experience with machine learning or other modeling techniques
* Programming skills in Python, R or Matlab

#### How to apply:

Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. The first review of applications will begin on 20th January 2020. If you are interested, please send one pdf-document including your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the contact details of two referees to:
Athina Tzovara, athina.tzovara@inf.unibe.ch 

Informal inquiries are welcome.



## Master thesis

**Title** EEG measurements of auditory predictions during sleep

In our daily lives we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information. Very often these do not occur in a random way but follow repetitive rules and patterns. The human brain possesses astonishing capacities of detecting patterns from the environment and predicting future events before these occur even when conscious access to the environment is reduced, e.g. during sleep. Predictive traces manifest in multiple stages of information processing, but it still remains unknown how they are modulated by conscious perception of the environment. The goal of this thesis is to study the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of sensory predictions during sleep and wakefulness. To this aim, we will perform electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers, in awake and asleep conditions, while presenting them with sound sequences, following regular or irregular patterns. We are looking for a master student to help us perform overnight EEG recordings at Inselspital and assist with data analysis.
